# PAYDAY 2 | Solo Achievements, Trophies and Side Jobs
English | [Russian](https://github.com/SparkVRX/pd2-solo-achievements-trophies-and-side-jobs/blob/main/README_RU.md)

This mod allows a solo player to complete **PAYDAY 2** 100%, get genuine pleasure and not resort to using glitches, cheats and other similar tricks. It gives the opportunity to complete absolutely all achievements and safehouse trophies intended only for co-op. We are talking about both those that are impossible to complete alone, and those that are incredibly difficult when playing alone. Also, community conditions checks for a series of side jobs and one achievement are disabled, which allows to fully enjoy the game even for those who do not use its licensed version.

## How does it work
**Conditions for the player**  
Each achievement/trophy that is designed for co-op now has conditions that can be completed solo. These conditions will only work when playing offline.

**Community conditions**  
For side jobs from the Event Missions list and the For all you legends achievement, community conditions checks have been disabled, which is relevant for those who do not use the licensed version of the game.

**Achievement/Trophies Descriptions**  
The descriptions of the affected achievements and trophies in the game itself have been changed. This eliminates the need to constantly return to this page to find out the conditions.
